<h1>JavaScript Breakout Clone</h1>

Simple JS breakout game that has mouse and keyboard controls to move the paddle. You start the game with 3 lives and there is an end game alert for either "game over" or "you win".

Basic instructions are included in the browser and number of lives as well as a live score are displayed in the canvas.

To make the game more interesting and difficult the ball speeds up every time it collides with the paddle.

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

I plan to make the canvas larger and more complex as time goes by as well as implementing background music and sfx.
